Certainly! Here are some medium-level coding questions that cover a range of topics including data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving:

1. **Array Manipulation:**
   - Given an array of integers, find the subarray with the maximum sum (Kadane's Algorithm).

2. **Linked Lists:**
   - Reverse a linked list.
   - Detect if a linked list has a cycle.

3. **Strings:**
   - Given two strings, write a function to check if one is a permutation of the other.
   - Implement a basic string compression algorithm.

4. **Trees and Graphs:**
   - Implement an algorithm to check if a binary tree is balanced.
   - Given a directed graph, implement an algorithm to find a route between two nodes.

5. **Sorting and Searching:**
   - Implement binary search in a rotated sorted array.
   - Given a matrix of integers, search for a specific element efficiently.

6. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Implement the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming to optimize the recursive solution.
   - Given a set of coins with different denominations, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up a specific amount.

7. **Backtracking:**
   - Solve the N-Queens problem.
   - Implement a Sudoku solver.

8. **Greedy Algorithms:**
   - Implement Huffman Coding for compression.
   - Given a set of activities with start and end times, find the maximum number of activities that can be performed without overlapping.

9. **Hashing:**
   - Implement a hash table from scratch.
   - Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

10. **Bit Manipulation:**
    - Write a function to count the number of bits set to 1 in an integer.
    - Swap two numbers without using a temporary variable.

These medium-level coding questions cover a variety of concepts and are commonly used in technical interviews to assess problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
