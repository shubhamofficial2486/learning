a list of coding questions related to Java 8 that might be asked during an interview. These questions cover various aspects of Java 8 features, such as lambda expressions, streams, functional interfaces, and more:

1. **Lambda Expressions:**
   - Write a lambda expression to square each element of a list.
   - Use lambda expressions to filter a list of strings starting with a specific letter.
   - Sort a list of strings using lambda expressions based on their lengths.

2. **Streams API:**
   - Create a stream of integers and find the sum of all elements.
   - Given a list of names, convert them to uppercase using streams.
   - Use streams to filter and collect elements from a list.

3. **Functional Interfaces:**
   - Create a functional interface with a single abstract method and use it with a lambda expression.
   - Implement a custom functional interface for a specific use case.

4. **Method References:**
   - Replace a lambda expression with a method reference for a specific scenario.
   - Use a method reference to create a comparator for sorting a list.

5. **Default Methods:**
   - Create an interface with a default method and implement it in a class.
   - Deal with multiple inheritance using default methods.

6. **Optional Class:**
   - Use `Optional` to handle a potentially null value and provide a default if it's absent.
   - Implement a method that returns an `Optional` based on certain conditions.

7. **New Date and Time API:**
   - Calculate the difference between two dates using the `LocalDate` class.
   - Convert a `LocalDateTime` to a different time zone using the `ZonedDateTime` class.

8. **Streams and Collectors:**
   - Use the `Collectors` class to group elements of a list by a certain criteria.
   - Combine multiple streams into one using `Stream.concat()`.

9. **Advanced Stream Operations:**
   - Implement a custom collector for a specific use case.
   - Use `flatMap` to flatten nested lists in a stream.

10. **Parallel Streams:**
    - Convert a sequential stream to a parallel stream and observe the difference in performance.
    - Identify scenarios where parallel streams might be beneficial.

These coding questions cover a range of Java 8 features and can help assess a candidate's understanding and practical skills with Java 8 programming. During the interview, candidates might be asked to explain their thought process and optimize their solutions.
 **Here are some common Java 8 coding questions you might encounter in interviews, covering key features like streams, lambda expressions, and functional interfaces:**

**Streams:**

* **Filter elements:**
    - Remove duplicates from a list.
    - Find numbers starting with 1.
    - Find elements greater than a certain value.
* **Sort elements:**
    - Sort a list of names alphabetically.
    - Sort numbers in descending order.
* **Map elements:**
    - Convert strings to uppercase.
    - Square each number in a list.
    - Create a new list with elements in a different format.
* **Reduce elements:**
    - Sum all numbers in a list.
    - Find the longest string in a list.
    - Find the most frequent element in a list.

**Lambda Expressions:**

* **Implement simple operations:**
    - Compare two numbers.
    - Check if a string is empty.
* **Apply functions to collections:**
    - Sort a list using a custom comparator.
    - Filter a map based on a condition.

**Functional Interfaces:**

* **Use built-in functional interfaces:**
    - `Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Function`, `Supplier`
* **Create custom functional interfaces:**
    - Define a functional interface for a specific operation.

**Other Features:**

* **Optional class:**
    - Handle potential null values gracefully.
* **Method references:**
    - Refer to existing methods concisely.
* **Default methods in interfaces:**
    - Add new methods to existing interfaces without breaking compatibility.

**Additional Tips:**

* Practice with a variety of coding challenges to strengthen your Java 8 skills.
* Understand the core concepts behind streams, lambda expressions, and functional interfaces.
* Be prepared to explain your code clearly and concisely to the interviewer.
* Demonstrate good coding practices, such as proper formatting, meaningful variable names, and comments.
